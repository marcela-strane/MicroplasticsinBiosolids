# MicroplasticsinBiosolids
An active reference library of microplastics found in biosolids
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
A repository consisting of microplastics found in HouActinite biosolids to better represent what types of microplastics are commonly found in biosolids, wastewater derived sludge.
Check out specific Raman spectra for each type of microplastic found and compare to the Raman spectras you create.
